# SudokuTelegramBot
this is a bot in python for telegram. I used pyTelegramBotAPI to create this bot and it's game is different from the regular 9x9 sudoku.  
this game is a 6x6 sudoku that uses 1-6 numbers to fill it with. and it has some points calculating philosophy that you get +3 points when you choose the right number and -2 points when your choice is wrong.  
so enjoy and use it to understand it's gameplay. by the way, in it's menu if you click on guide button you will see a guide therefore you can learn how to use this bot.  
it's language is Persian so if your language is English you won't probably understand this bot!
